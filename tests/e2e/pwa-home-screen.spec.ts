/**
 * tests/e2e/pwa-home-screen.spec.ts — regression test for the iOS "Add to
 * Home Screen" bug: iOS bakes whichever manifest is LINKED from the current
 * page into the saved icon's `start_url`, discarding the page's own URL —
 * confirmed on-device even when Add to Home Screen was tapped directly from
 * `/pin/<slug>`, because that page was (before the fix below) still linking
 * the site-wide manifest, whose `start_url` is the generic `/pin` gate.
 * Playwright can't literally drive iOS's native Add-to-Home-Screen sheet, so
 * this proves the two things iOS actually reads:
 *
 *   1. `/pin/<slug>` links ITS OWN manifest (not the site-wide one), and that
 *      manifest's `start_url` is that exact family's `/pin/<slug>` — so Add
 *      to Home Screen from a family's own page bakes the full URL into the
 *      saved icon directly, no redirect involved;
 *   2. the site-wide manifest (linked from every other page, e.g. the bare
 *      `/pin` gate) still starts at `/pin`, not `/` (site root → `/login`
 *      for an anonymous visitor, with no family context at all) — a
 *      fallback for a bookmark saved with no specific family page open, and
 *      for platforms (Android/Chrome) that don't isolate installed-PWA
 *      storage from the browser, where RememberSlug's localStorage redirect
 *      still works.
